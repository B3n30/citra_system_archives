System Files Generator for Citra
==============

Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++. Running certain games requires some system archives.
Since the ones from the 3ds are copyrighted this creates custom system archives.

Currently only the general shared font archive is supported.

### Building

Requires Python 3, pypng, and Python Image Library
